# Matching-Script-for-Twiss-Functions-Accelerator-Physics
This script will match twiss functions and magnetic elements for designing lattices. It uses linear matrix transport of Courant-Snyder parameters(3x3) linear matrix for matching drift lengths, quadrupole focusing strengths, solenoid focusing strengths as well as find the optimal twiss functions.
